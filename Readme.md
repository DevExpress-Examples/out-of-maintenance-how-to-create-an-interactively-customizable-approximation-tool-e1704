# How to create an interactively customizable approximation tool


<p>This example demonstrates how to create a tool to approximate a discrete set of points by a smooth curve. In this example the exponential dependency for this curve is used. However, you can easily replace it with another standard (e. g. linear) or custom dependency by overriding the approximation logic in the Form1.Approximate() method based on the source's data set  (see the "Scattered" series in the source code). </p><p>This example is similar to the following ones:</p><p><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E294">How to make points in a ChartControl adjustable interactively</a><br />
